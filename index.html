                <p>
                    I have always had an interest in mathematics which led me to engineering in college. I held two engineering internship positions at Boeing 
                    during my undergraduate but found that physics and mathematics was my true passion in my studies. After graduating with a BA in 
                    mathematics and BS in Physics from University of Washington, I then decided to take a year off to work at the applied physics lab at 
                    UW. This further excelled my engineering experience via circuit design, sensor calibration, lab testing, and analysis. As a graduate 
                    student of physics at Northeastern, I eventually discovered a new interest in machine learning and computer programming/software engineering.

                    I then went on to study physics and eventually recieved my Masters in Science for Physics at Northeastern University while reseaching with the CMS group 
                    with a focus on machine learning and large data analytics. This naturally exposed me to the experience I would need to then get a job as a 
                    Software Development Engineer at Blue Origin, which I currently hold. My current job title is a full stack developer for the Enterprise Manufacturing
                    Execution team. As such, I utilize various programming languages to fix and improve all aspects of web applications from front-to-backend. While working 
                    and learning as a new software engineer, I will continue to push my boundaries and learn all that I can whitin the field of full stack development.
