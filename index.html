                <p>
                    I have always had an interest in mathematics which led me to engineering in college. I held two engineering internship positions at Boeing 
                    during my undergraduate but found that physics and mathematics was my true passion in my studies. After graduating with a BA in 
                    mathematics and BS in Physics from University of Washington, I then decided to take a year off to work at the applied physics lab at 
                    UW. This further excelled my engineering experience via circuit design, sensor calibration, lab testing, and analysis. As a graduate 
                    student of physics at Northeastern, I eventually discovered a new interest in machine learning and computer programming/software engineering. 
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    I then went on to study physics and eventually recieved my Masters in Science for Physics at Northeastern University while reseaching with the CMS group 
                    with a focus on machine learning and large data analytics. This naturally exposed me to the experience I would need to then get a job as a 
                    Software Development Engineer at Blue Origin, which I currently hold. My current job title is a full stack developer for the Enterprise Manufacturing
                    Execution team. As such, I utilize various programming languages to fix and improve all aspects of web applications from front-to-backend. While working 
                    and learning as a new software engineer, I will continue to push my boundaries and learn all that I can within the field of full stack development.

                    Outside of education and work, I love to play golf (when it's not raining), hike with my wife and giant dog, visit local breweries with friends,
                    and play video games (favorites are Elden Ring and Halo Infinite at the moment).
