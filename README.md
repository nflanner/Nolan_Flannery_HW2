# Exploring My Portfolio

Thank you for visiting my partial portfolio for full-stack software development. Please feel free to explore as you wish, I will quickly highlight the many features of the portfolio. 

### _Overview_

First, the navigation bar on the header of the page (with my name and picture) house three navigation buttons that will take you to the different sections, including 'About Me', 'My Portfolio', and 'Contact'. 

'About Me' shares some information about myself, such as previous work/education experience and hobbies. 'My Portfolio' Is where some of my previous software projects can be found. Hovering over any application block will display the name and clicking on any of the projects will take you directly to the specific deployed application. Finally, the 'Contact' session contains all the information needed to contact me. This includes my personal and work email addresses, phone number, and links to my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles.

### _Technical Overview_

This portfolio features the use of fundamental HTML i.e. no bootstrap or similar packages. I utilized various semantic flags, numerous attributes, and followed typical HTML best practices. The main content structure includes a minimalistic header, navigation bar with reference links to the content,  and main body content that utilizes nested flex-boxes. Without a bootstrap-like package, all the HTML was hand-styled with CSS and includes dynamic media queries.

The idea behind the portfolio was to demonstrate the use of fundamental website creation and styling. This could be done much more efficiently using a package similar to bootstrap, however, that is not what the focus was intended to be. For showcasing of such packages with JavaScript to allow a more efficient dynamic webpage ability, see my deployed projects via this portfolio.

# Deployed Application Descriptions


## _Netflix Roulette_

### _Overview_

No longer does anyone have to sit endlessly scrolling movie selections. Our app eleiminates the many hours in between. All you need to do is pick your genre, and start the roullete! If you are not as brave, then you can select the additional information button to learn more about the movie that was seleed for you. 
If you want the full experience, don't even select a genre and you will get a random genre and movie within that genre!

Addtionally, you can log recent movies you watched with the associated genre and user-typed socring (on a scale of zero to ten). Your recent movie selections will be saved to your own browser so that you can reference your movie likes (or dislikes) accordingly for your next roulette.

This project utilizes the [Adanced Movie API](https://advanced-movie-search.p.rapidapi.com) to search by genre and the [OMDBapi](http://omdapi.com/) to deliver a more in-depth overview of the selected Roulette Movie. Recent watches are saved into `localstorage`  via the client-side javascript api.

### _Technical Overview_

The goal of this project was to develop a dynamic web application with a practical use in mind. In particular, this web application was made to showcase an example of a purely front-end application via open-source API's.

Some specific features used were fetch queries on two different API's, dynamically updated features (such as lists, images, text containers etc.). This project utilizes Bootstrap components, specifically: navbar, cards, scrollable textboxes, clickable buttons, and dynamically updated lists that use `localstorage`. Additionally, DOM manipulation was utilized using jQuery.
