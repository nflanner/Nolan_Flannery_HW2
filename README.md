## Exploring My Portfolio

Thank you for visiting my partial portfolio for full-stack software development. Please feel free to explore as you wish, I will quickly highlight the many features of the portfolio. 

First, the navigation bar on the header of the page (with my name and picture) house three navigation buttons that will take you to the different sections, including 'About Me', 'My Portfolio', and 'Contact'. 

'About Me' shares some information about myself, such as previous work/education experience and hobbies. 'My Portfolio' Is where some of my previous software projects can be found. Hovering over any application block will display the name and clicking on any of the projects will take you directly to the specific deployed application. Finally, the 'Contact' session contains all the information needed to contact me. This includes my personal and work email addresses, phone number, and links to my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles.

Again, thank you for exploring my portfolio, I hope you enjoy and please reach out to me directly with any questions.
